            <h2>1. Thrift Shopping</h2>
            <p>Thrift shopping is a sustainable and affordable alternative to fast fashion. By purchasing second-hand clothing, you reduce waste and give pre-loved items a new life. Individuals can also donate their own clothes to second-hand stores, giving consumers a wide range of affordable and sustainable clothing options.</p>

            <h2>3. Shopping From Ethical and Sustainable Brands</h2>
            <p> Support brands that are committed to ethical practices. Fast fashion has a high volume of production and often neglects the welfare of workers. Ethical brands prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and sustainable materials.</p>
