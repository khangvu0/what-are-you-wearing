            <p class="photo__description">Thrift shopping is a sustainable and affordable alternative to fast fashion.

Websites and apps allow users to list their gently used items for sale or trade, promoting a circular fashion economy. For example, social media platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Depop, Poshmark, and Instagram facilitate this process. </p>

            <p class="photo__description"> Support brands that are committed to ethical practices. Fast fashion has a high volume of production and often neglects the welfare of workers. Ethical brands prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and sustainable materials. Brands that are fast fashion are Nike, H&M, Shein and Zara. Some sustainable brands to shop from include Patagonia, Scotch & Soda, and Thousand Fell.</p>
