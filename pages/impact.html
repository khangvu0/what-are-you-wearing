    <h1> Causes</h1>
    <h2> Environmental Impact </h2>

    <p> People worldwide are buying more clothes than they did a decade ago, and fast fashion has taken the center stage to meet the ever rising demand. The environmental impact of fast fashion is undeniable, with the industry now responsible for 10% of the global annual carbon footprint, which is more than the emissions from all international flights and maritime shipping combined. </p>

        O₂ emissions
        <p> The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions—more than international flights and maritime shipping combined. Fast fashion’s short production cycles and global distribution rely heavily on fossil fuels, from textile manufacturing to delivery. </p>
        <h6> Fun Fact: Producing one pair of jeans emits as much CO₂ as driving a car for over 80 miles.</h6>
        Water usage and pollution
        <p> Producing textiles uses an enormous amount of water. A single cotton T-shirt can require up to 2,700 liters of water—enough for one person to drink for 2.5 years. Toxic chemicals used in dyeing processes often flow untreated into rivers, contaminating drinking water and harming ecosystems.</p>
        <h6> Fun Fact: The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter of clean water globally.</h6>

        <h6> Fun Fact: One washload of polyester clothes can release 700,000+ microplastic fibers.</h6>        </ul>

    <h1> Social Impact </h1>
    <h4>Worker Exploitation
        <p> Fast fashion brands often rely on supply chains in countries with lax labor laws, where workers are paid below a living wage. Garment workers may earn as little as $2–$6 per day, often for long hours in poor conditions.</p>
        <h6>Fun Fact: In some factories, workers sew clothing for 14–16 hours per day, 7 days a week.</h6>
        
       Gender Inequality
        <p>Up to 80% of garment workers are women, many of whom face discrimination, harassment, and limited opportunities for advancement. Gender-based violence and intimidation are widely reported in factories, particularly in Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia.</p>

        <h6> Fun Fact: Only a fraction of these women have access to basic labor rights or childcare support. </h6>
        Unsafe Labor Conditions
        <p> The push for cheap, fast production often leads to unsafe factory conditions. The 2013 Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh killed over 1,100 workers, highlighting the deadly risks of poorly regulated fast fashion supply chains.</p>
        <h6>Fun Fact: Thousands of workers globally still labor in structurally unsafe buildings with no protective oversight.</h6>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <h4> 
        <ul>
        Purchase from ethical brands
        <p> Certifications like Fair Wear, GOTS, and OEKO-TEX help identify brands that meet high environmental and ethical standards.

</p>
       
        Recycle
        <p> Some major brands now offer clothing take-back programs—turning used garments into new textiles, insulation, or industrial materials. This helps reduce landfill waste and promote a circular economy. Extend clothing life by mending or upcycling, or organize clothing swaps instead of shopping new.</p>
        
        Government regulations
        <p>Some major brands now offer clothing take-back programs—turning used garments into new textiles, insulation, or industrial materials. This helps reduce landfill waste and promote a circular economy.
        The EU’s Textile Strategy pushes for durable, repairable, and recyclable clothing. By 2030, all textiles sold in the EU must meet new sustainability standards.
        More countries are exploring laws to hold fashion brands accountable for waste and labor conditions. </p>
