    <h1> Explore the True Costs</h1>
    <h2> Environmental Impact </h2>
    <p> People worldwide are purchasing more clothing than they were a decade ago, with fast fashion emerging as a dominant force to satisfy the increasing demand. The environmental consequences of fast fashion are indisputable, influencing a variety of factors.

 </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
    <div class="causes__point">
    <h3> O₂ Emissions </h3>
        <p> The fashion industry accounts for 10% of worldwide carbon emissions, surpassing the combined emissions from international flights and maritime shipping. The rapid production cycles and extensive distribution of fast fashion are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, impacting everything from textile production to transportation. </p>

        </div>
        <h6> Fun Fact: Producing one pair of jeans emits as much CO₂ as driving a car for over 80 miles.</h6>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="causes__point">
    <h3> Microplastics </h3>
        <p> Synthetic materials such as polyester release millions of microplastics with every wash, contributing to pollution in our oceans and affecting wildlife. Additionally, the fast fashion industry produces vast amounts of textile waste, resulting in millions of tons of clothing being discarded in landfills annually.

        </div>
        <h6> Fun Fact: One washload of polyester clothes can release 700,000+ microplastic fibers.</h6>
    </div>

        <div class="causes__point">
    <h3> Water Usage and Pollution </h3>
        <p> The production of textiles consumes a significant quantity of water. For instance, a single cotton T-shirt may need as much as 2,700 liters of water—sufficient for one individual to drink for 2.5 years. Additionally, harmful chemicals utilized in dyeing processes frequently enter rivers without treatment, polluting drinking water and damaging ecosystems.</p>

        </div>
        <h6> Fun Fact: The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter of clean water globally.</h6>

    <section id="content__social--paragraph">
     <h2> Social Impact </h2>
     <p> The demand for rapid production can lead to exploitation, including child labor and unsafe factory environments. Additionally, the pressure to produce cheap clothing quickly often results in human rights violations across the supply chain.</p>
     </div>

    <div class="container">
    <div class="social__point">
    <h3> Worker Exploitation </h3>
        <p> Fast fashion companies frequently depend on supply chains located in nations with lenient labor regulations, where employees receive compensation that falls below a living wage. Workers in the garment industry might make as little as $2 to $6 daily, typically enduring long hours in substandard conditions.</p>
        <div class="causes__img">
            <img src="../images/PA-57401471.max-760x504.jpg" alt="Textile Factory Work Environment">
        </div>
        <h6>Fun Fact: In some factories, workers sew clothing for 14–16 hours per day, 7 days a week.</h6>
    </div>

    </div>
        <div class="social__point">
    <h3> Gender Inequality </h3>
        <p>Approximately 80% of garment workers are women, many of whom face discrimination, harassment, and limited opportunities for advancement. Gender-based violence and intimidation are widely reported in factories, particularly in Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia.</p>
        <div class="causes__img">
            <img src="../images/garment+worker+protest.jpeg" alt="Women Workers Protesting">
        </div>
        <h6> Fun Fact: Only a fraction of these women have access to basic labor rights or childcare support. </h6>
    </div>

        <div class="social__point">
    <h3> Unsafe Labor Conditions </h3>
        <p> The drive for inexpensive and rapid production frequently results in hazardous working conditions in factories. The tragic collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013 resulted in the loss of more than 1,100 lives, underscoring the perilous dangers associated with inadequately regulated fast fashion supply chains.

                <h6> Fun Fact: Thousands of workers globally still labor in structurally unsafe buildings with no protective oversight. </h6>

    <h1> What can <em> U </em> do?</h1>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <p> Consumers can reduce the impact of fast fashion in different ways that still allows you to remain trendy but is also alot more sustainable. Some major brands now offer clothing take-back programs—turning used garments into new textiles, insulation, or industrial materials. This helps reduce landfill waste and promote a circular economy.</p>

    <div class="solutions__point">
    <h3> Purchase from Ethical Brands </h3>
        <p> Certifications such as Fair Wear, GOTS, and OEKO-TEX assist in recognizing brands that adhere to elevated environmental and ethical criteria. </p>

    <h3> Recycle </h3>
        <p> Extend clothing life by mending or upcycling, or organize clothing swaps instead of shopping new. </p>
        
    <h3> Government Regulations</h3>
        <p> The EU's Textile Strategy advocates for clothing that is durable, repairable, and recyclable. By 2030, all textiles available in the EU will be required to comply with new sustainability standards. An increasing number of countries are considering legislation to ensure that fashion brands are responsible for waste management and labor conditions. </p>
