    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our *totally legit* donation page where your money will go towards saving the world from the evil empire of Fast Fashion. Before you proceed with donating your hard-earned cash to fight this global villain, please take a moment to read through our whimsical yet *totally binding* Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <h2>1. The Power of Your Donation</h2>
    <p>Your donation will help to raise awareness, support sustainable brands, and educate people about the dangers of fast fashion. Each penny will fight for a better tomorrow (and possibly lunch for the the team of fast4ward).</p>

    <h2>2. No Refunds</h2>
    <p>Once you've donated, there's no going back. Like that $5 salad you bought the other day (no free salad?)... You can’t return that either. But don’t worry, your donation will be *so worth it*, and you’ll get tons of good karma.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Data: Kept Safe</h2>
    <p>We promise not to sell your information to anyone. No one wants your email address, pretty arrogant to think so, no? We’ll just use it to send you updates about your donation.</p>
    <p>(*No promises with what Khang will do with your information*)</p>

    <h2>4. The Hater Clause</h2>
    <p>By donating, you agree to forever despise cheap synthetic fabrics, support brands that make clothes with love (and the planet in mind), and never buy another plastic-based T-shirt again.</p>

    <h2>5. We’re Just Here to Have Fun (But Seriously… Help Us Out)</h2>
    <p>While we do enjoy making jokes, the cause we’re fighting for is 100% serious. Fast fashion harms people, the planet, and your wardrobe’s long-term happiness. So, your donation means a lot. And we mean a lot!</p>

    <h2>6. The Fun Clause</h2>
    <p>If you found this Terms and Conditions page even remotely entertaining, we owe you a high-five. Seriously. It’s not every day we get to put "fun" in legal jargon!</p>

    <p class="disclaimer">By clicking "I Agree", you’re legally agreeing to all the fun stuff and also supporting a global movement to fight against the evils of fast fashion.</p>
