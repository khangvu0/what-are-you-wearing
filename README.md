# 'What Are You Wearing?' by fast4ward
This project is for Code for Justice, in which it is a hackathon activity that focuses on creating a
website for a non-existent non-profit organization that aims to address a social issue.

# Our Brand
In this case, the non-profit organization is called fast4ward, which is a play on 'fast fashion' that addresses that social issue through an initiative called 'What Are You Wearing?' The name of the initiative is also a play where we are not actually asking what brands you are wearing, but what are the things that were sacrificed to create what you are wearing on your body. For example, child labor, textile pollution, deforestation, etc.

Additionally, for the appearance of the website, we decided simple is best; as our primary goal was to focus on education and awareness. This entails a simple design followed by eye-catching images, strong attention grabbers for headers and titles, and easy navigation.
